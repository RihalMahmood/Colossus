### Many drives. One titan.

**Colossus** is an open-source cloud storage platform that merges multiple Google Drive accounts into a single, unified storage pool. Connect as many Google Drive accounts as you want - Colossus handles the rest, automatically splitting large files across drives and reassembling them seamlessly on download.

## What is Colossus?

Every free Google account comes with **15 GB** of Drive storage. Colossus lets you connect *any number* of Google accounts and treats them as a single, massive drive.

- 3 accounts → **45 GB**
- 10 accounts → **150 GB**
- 20 accounts → **300 GB**

No subscriptions. No paid tiers. Just your own Google accounts, unified.

## Features

- **Unified Storage Pool** - Browse, search, and manage files across all connected drives from one interface
- **Smart Auto-Chunking** - Files too large for a single drive are automatically split across multiple drives and reassembled transparently on download
- **Storage Intelligence** - Colossus always writes to the drive with the most free space first, minimizing unnecessary splits
- **Secure Auth** - Platform login via JWT + Google Drive connected via OAuth 2.0 (your credentials never touch our servers)
- **Storage Dashboard** - See total, used, and free space across all drives individually and combined
- **File Management** - Upload via drag & drop, search by name, download (with auto-merge for chunked files), and delete
- **Glassmorphism UI** - Dark, premium interface built with Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- A Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials

---

### Step 1 — Google Cloud Setup

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Enable APIs** → enable **Google Drive API**
3. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Set application type to **Web application**
5. Add this to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/drives/oauth/callback
   ```
6. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. Go to **OAuth consent screen** → add your email(s) as test users

---

### Step 2 - Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/colossus
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/api/drives/oauth/callback

CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 3 - Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` 🎉

## How Chunking Works

```
Upload Request
      │
      ▼
Fetch free space for all drives
Sort by free space (highest first)
      │
      ├─ Top drive has enough space?
      │         YES → Upload directly, done ✅
      │
      └─ NO → Split into chunks:
              Chunk 1 → Drive with most free space
              Chunk 2 → Drive with next most free space
              Chunk N → Continue until file is fully uploaded
              Save chunk map to MongoDB
                    │
                    ▼
            Download Request
                    │
              Fetch chunk map
              Stream chunks in order
              Reassemble → single file ✅
```

Each chunk's location (drive account + Google file ID + byte range) is stored in the `FileMetadata` collection, allowing perfect reassembly regardless of which drives were used.
